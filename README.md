<h1>50 Projects in 50 Days</h1>
<p>A popular take on the famous Udemy course</p>

<p>Not being able to afford the course at its full price, I decided to challenge myself and try to recreate all the projects simply by using a trial and error approach by copying the demonstration versions of the projects on the official website https://50projects50days.com/</p>

<p>To see all the projects, completed or not, visit this link: https://projects-in-50-days.web.app</p>
