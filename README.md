<h1>50 Projects in 50 Days</h1>
<p>A popular take on the famous Udemy course</p>

<p>Not being able to afford the course at its full price, I decided to challenge myself and try to recreate all the projects simply by using a trial and error approach by copying the demonstration versions of the projects on the official website https://50projects50days.com/</p>

<p>
This has been one of the best series of projects that I made. Almost every summer evening of 2020, with the fresh air coming through the window, I focused on a different task, varying my fields of study each time
</p>

<p>
Looking back at the various projects, I was able to notice not only an improvement during the progression in the projects, but also a marked improvement in my skills in about two years after completion, and I think it is a positive sign for my path to become a good programmer.
